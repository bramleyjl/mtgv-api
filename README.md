# MTG Versioner API

A RESTful API service that processes Magic: the Gathering card lists and returns complete "packages" containing all available printings of those cards with customizable sorting and filtering options.

## Overview

MTG Versioner API allows you to:

- Submit a list of Magic: the Gathering cards and receive all available printings
- Filter results by game platform (paper, MTGO, Arena)
- Sort results by various criteria (newest, oldest, most expensive, least expensive)
- Generate random card packages for exploration
- Export card packages in various formats (TCGPlayer, text)

The API serves as a backend for card collection management tools, deck builders, or any application that needs access to Magic card print information with filtering capabilities.
